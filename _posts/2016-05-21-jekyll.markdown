Yep, I recreated the site and switched to **Jekyll**. As I was already using *Markdown* to format my posts the porting did not take that much time. Jekyll is nice to build static websites, fits perfect for my blog.
Also it has less attack vectors as a dynamic website because nothing get's intepreted, for example from PHP. No database connection, no GET variables, nothing.

GitHub is also beeing used to backup my website and commit changes, my server takes them then and Jekyll rebuilds the website. Awesome!

A few bugs are still present, like the fact that emojis are not parsed. I hope that get's resolved soon.

So, happy browsing on my blog and enjoy the new speed!
