Hello, my name is Markus and I hunt malware authors. I'm since a few years a member of the awesome anti malware group **MalwareMustDie**. I punish malware authors and beat down botnets together with **MMD**.

When I'm not hunting for malware I mostly code and maintain several servers. Languages I code are *PHP*, *Python*, *JavaScript*, *C* and *Bash*. 

And when I am off the PC I read novels.
